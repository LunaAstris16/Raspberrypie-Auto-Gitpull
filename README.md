# Raspberrypie-Auto-Gitpull
This is code to make it so that your raspberry pie always stays up to date with what's on your GitHub.

Currently this program will make a folder and will run your PYTHON file. 
It will also keep your running System up to date with the most current version of your main branch

This is currently underDevelopment.
I am working to make this more user friendly and a better application over all.
In the futre look I am looking to add
  -Handeling for multiple different programs
  -Make it run lots of different kinds of file and launch lots of different kinds of languages
  -allow for better file manipulation in the futre
